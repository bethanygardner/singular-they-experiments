    This study involves reading PSA (public service announcement) texts on various topics, reading descriptions 
    of different people, and then answering questions about what you have read. 
    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
    Some of the questions ask you to record yourself speaking out loud. To do this, you need to have a computer 
    with a microphone, be in a quiet place, and be comfortable speaking English.

    After you read the consent form, your browser will ask for permission to use your microphone,
    and there will be a test trial to make sure it is working.
